    <section title="TOE Overview" id="overview"> Redaction is the process of selectively removing
      and replacing information from a document or other logical container of data for release to an
      audience not intended to view that information. Redacted information is not limited to
      classified material; other examples include privacy data, proprietary information, trade
      secrets, and legal strategy. Instances of redaction include replacing classified text with a
      black box to release a document to an unclassified environment, replacing privacy-related data
      such as telephone numbers with all Xs to release a database to a contractor, converting a
      proprietary format document to Portable Document Format (PDF) to release a
      what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) document. The risk from improper or incomplete
      redaction is the inadvertent disclosure of classified or sensitive data.<br/> Redaction has
      become a more complex problem due to electronic file formats, including documents,
      spreadsheets, databases or others that act as a logical container for data. These formats
      include the visual content as well as hidden data such as document properties, comments, and
      executable content. Users cannot easily access or examine some of the hidden data making it a
      substantial avenue for inadvertent disclosure. Redaction tools are designed to assist the user
      with review and removal of both visible and hidden information.<br/> In the past, the typical
      redaction method for electronic documents was to print the document, black out the necessary
      information, then make a photocopy releasing a physical document. This paper method has the
      advantage of assurance but the disadvantage of loss of usability. The physical printed copy is
      exactly what is visible, a true WYSIWYG representation of the information. The photocopy could
      be scanned back into the computer for release as an electronic document, but the usability is
      greatly diminished. This method of redaction is no longer satisfactory in situations where the
      released document must retain the usability of the original source, or in situations where the
      object is not a document but a database table or other unprintable container.<br/> Redaction
      is not sanitization. In the sanitization process, information is removed with no indication
      that the sanitization process took place. In the redaction process, selected visible
      information is removed and replaced with something innocuous (e.g. black box or text) so that
      the reader knows redaction took place. This replacement is a critical part of the process not
      shared with sanitization. <subsection title="Types of Data - Terminology for Requirements"
        id="typesofdata"> An electronic document is a logical container that is the product of an
        application such as a word processor or other text-based editor. Documents contain data in
        the form of text, images, video, audio, or other embedded logical containers such as
        spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)).<br/> Data that users may
        need to redact from documents falls into two broad types: visible data and hidden data. The
        same element of a document can have both a visual representation as well as a different
        hidden representation. For example, the image displayed to the user may be a smaller size
        and resolution from the image stored in the internal format of the document file. The
        following terms for types of visible and hidden data are established for use in the
        requirements section of the protection profile:<br/> Visible Data:<br/>

          <entry>
            <term>Simplify (or simplified)</term>
            <description>replace a complex object or element with a single layer element that does
              not contain hidden or obscured data. The original representation of the object and all
              of the original hidden data must be removed from the document and the visible space
              must be replaced with the simplified element. For example, a document could contain an
              embedded spreadsheet on a page where only a small portion of the spreadsheet is
              visible within the view container on the page while content in the rest of the
              spreadsheet is in the document but hidden from the viewer. To simplify such an object,
              the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> could create a single layer image (with no metadata of its own) from just the
              portion of the spreadsheet that is visible, place that image on the page and remove
              the embedded spreadsheet. This is just one solution. The intent of simplifying an
              object is to remove something complex that could contain hidden data and replace it
              with something simple that does not contain hidden data. </description>

            <term>Examine a test file or document</term>
            <description>the evaluator uses a hex editor or similar tool to view the raw binary (or
              hex) data of the file and the format structure. This allows the evaluator to view the
              contents of the file directly rather than through the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>’s interpretation of those
              contents. The examination can include the use of tools to extract, decode or
              decompress certain types of elements from the format, such as text or images. Care
              must be taken so that the extraction process does not change the element’s size,
              resolution, or content. The Technical Community will identify appropriate tools.

            <description>follow the multi-step process where the user selects or marks areas or
              items in a document for redaction and then instructs the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> to redact the marked

            <term>Test files</term>
            <description>to test the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>, the evaluator will have to use test documents that have
              content expected to produce a certain result. The evaluator will apply the redaction
              tool to the test files and examine the output to determine if it is as expected. The
              same test documents can be used for each <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> that produces the same format as those
              test documents. For example, a set of PDF test files can be used for all PDF redaction
              tools. Test files will usually contain only one testable item at a time to make it
              easier to identify that item in the structure of the document, but some test files
              should contain multiple testable items. The Technical Community will create a set of
              test files for the assurance activities for the most common formats. </description>

    <section title="Use Case" id="usecase">A user needs to release an electronic document to an
      audience outside of some boundary. Some of the information in the document must not be
      available to that audience. The user must first redact this information from the document
      before moving the document across the boundary. The user manually selects the data to be
      redacted with an interactive software application. The format of the source and destination
      documents can be the same or different.<br/>
      <figure entity="images/workflow.jpg"
        title="Figure 1: One possible workflow of an electronic document through the redaction process."
        id="workflow"/> Figure 1 shows the typical workflow of a document from source to destination
      and through the redaction process. The original source of the document can be either internal
      or external to the system which hosts the redaction tool. If the source is external, the
      document will first go through the system’s security policy for importing documents, e.g.
      virus scanning. A document from an internal source was either created on the system or has
      already gone through security scans. When a document enters the redaction process, it should
      have already been checked for malicious executable content.<br/> During the pre-release
      process, the user or another authority in the workflow determines what to redact using the
      organization’s information policies or declassification guidelines. The authority makes a
      determination about the release of images, audio, video or other complex objects that are in
      the document that may require other pre-processing before release. For example, the document
      will be examined for potential steganography attacks or a decision will be made to redact
      those portions that may contain such issues. For encrypted or password-protected files, the
      user will remove passwords and decrypt files during this phase, which assumes the host system
      is secured to a level appropriate to contain the decrypted data.<br/> There are several
      different types of interactive redaction tools: stand-alone, plug-in, or multi-purpose. A
      stand-alone tool is self-contained and performs only redaction-related functions. A plug-in
      performs redaction-related functions as part of another application when installed in that
      application. A multi-purpose tool includes other functionality along with built-in redaction
      functions, such as a word processor that includes built-in redaction functionality or a
      redaction tool that also performs encryption and digital signature functions. This protection
      profile applies to the redaction functionality in all of these types of interactive tools.
      <br/> During the redaction process, the user will manually mark visible data or select hidden
      data. The redaction tool will remove this data from the document in such a way that reverse
      engineering the document will not allow recovery of the redacted data. The organization should
      have a redaction policy that specifies which features of the redaction tool to use, such as
      whether to remove all hidden data automatically or to review and select elements individually,
      whether to replace redacted text with other text or with solid blocks of color, what color to
      use, etc. While this policy is part of the redaction process, it is separate from the
      redaction tool.<br/> The organization will apply review and final approval policies during the
      review and release process. There may also be post-processing requirements for the document
      such as inserting special metadata, adding passwords, document encryption or digital
      signature. The redaction tool may include the functionality to perform these post-processing
      requirements but they are not within the scope of the redaction functionality of the
      tool.<br/> Once approved for release, the organization may have additional inspection and
      sanitization requirements that depend on the source and destination. For example, documents on
      a classified system may have to go through additional processing before being moved to an
      unclassified destination.<br/> Other workflows are possible. For example, decryption and
      re-encryption of data may be performed by the redaction tool without the data ever being saved
      as an intermediate file. Again, the host system is assumed to be secured to the level
      necessary for the decrypted data. Software vendors have the flexibility to devise their own
      workflow solutions for their target consumer. However, in any workflow, this protection
      profile applies only to the part of the workflow that is performed by the redaction tool and
      only to the redaction functionality in that tool. Other functionality in the redaction tool,
      other tools used in the workflow, the organization's redaction policy as well as security
      requirements and security policies that apply to other parts of the workflow is beyond the
      scope of this protection profile. </section>
    <section title="TOE Scope" id="TOEscope"> This <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> is limited to the redaction of electronic
      documents defined in standards such as the series International Organization for Standards
      (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)-29500 (Office OpeneXtensible Markup
      Language (XML), e.g. Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents) and ISO/IEC-32000 (PDF),
      or the definitive standard for a format. This <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> applies to an interactive tool requiring the
      user to selectively review and redact information one document at a time. Mail guards,
      filters, and batch redaction tools are beyond the scope of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>.<br/> Requirements that
      apply to features such as administrative control over particular redaction settings,
      multi-person review prior to release, etc., are outside the scope of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>. The <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> may have
      those features but is not required to have them and their use and enforcement is governed by
      the organization’s redaction policy.<br/> This <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> covers the software functionality of the
      redaction process; it does not include requirements for how users should decide what to redact
      or other policy issues. Analysis of documents for covert data transfer is part of the
      decision-making process for what to redact and so occurs prior to the redaction itself. The
      requirements in this document are independent of requirements levied on document release by
      statute or the judiciary.<br/> Data execution risks inherent in some file formats are beyond
      the scope of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>. This <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> assumes that scanning for such risks occurs prior to the
      document entering the redaction functionality of the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>.<br/> Documents to be redacted may
      contain objects that are vulnerable to steganography, such as images or video. Functional data
      such as scripts can contain strings or images that may not be accessible to the redaction
      tool. Analysis of such objects for attacks or covert data transfer will occur outside of the
      redaction process. An organization’s security policy will determine whether such objects are
      released or redacted in their entirety.<br/>

  <chapter title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="sar">
    The Security Objectives for the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> in <secref linkend="req"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
        <secref linkend="threats"/>. The <span title="Security Functional Requirement">SFR</span>s in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal
      instantiation of the Security Objectives. The <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> draws from the <span title="Common Criteria">CC</span> <span title="Security Assurance Requirement">SAR</span>s) to frame the
      extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and
      performs independent testing. <br/> While this section contains the complete set of SARs from
      the <span title="Common Criteria">CC</span>, the Assurance Activities to be performed by an evaluator are detailed in <secref
        linkend="SFRs"/> as well as in this section. <br/>The general model for evaluating <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>s
      against STs written to conform to this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> is as follows: <br/>
    After the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> has been approved for evaluation, the Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) will obtain the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>, supporting IT environment, and the administrative guides for the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>.  The Assurance Activities listed in the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> (which will be refined by the CCTL to be <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>-specific, either within the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> or in a separate document) will then be performed by the CCTL. The results of these activities will be documented and presented (along with the administrative guidance used) for validation.<br></br>
    For each assurance family, “Developer Notes” are provided on the developer action elements to clarify what, if any, additional documentation/activity needs to be provided by the developer.  For the content/presentation and evaluator activity elements, additional assurance activities are described as a whole for the family, rather than for each element.  Additionally, the assurance activities described in this section are complementary to those specified in Section 4.2. <br></br>
    The <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> security assurance requirements, summarized in Table 2, identify the management and evaluative activities required to address the threats identified in Section 2 of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>. <br></br>

      The information about the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as well as the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> Summary Specification (<span title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</span>) portion of the <span title="Security Target">ST</span>.  While it is not required that the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> developer write the <span title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</span>, the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> developer must concur with the description of the product that is contained in the <span title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</span> as it relates to the functional requirements.  The Assurance Activities contained in Section 4.2, should provide the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> authors with sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the <span title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</span> section.
      <a-conmponent id="ADV_FSP.1" title="Basic Functional Specification">
        The functional specification describes the Target Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs).  It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces.  Additionally, because <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>s conforming to this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span> will necessarily have interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible.  For this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>, the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the <span title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</span> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation.  No additional “functional specification” documentation is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified.<br></br>
        The interfaces that need to be evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.<br></br>

The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/<span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> combinations that are claiming conformance to this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>.

        <aactivity>
          The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing aspects of the system.  The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the CEM and the body of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>’s Assurance Activities.  While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> is covered. <br></br>
          The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the <span title="Security Target">ST</span>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms.  This justification must address the differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed.  It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect; rationale must be provided.  If all platforms claimed in the <span title="Security Target">ST</span> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. <br></br>
          The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation.  It should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition.  This may include special test drivers or tools.  For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> and its platform.<br></br>  
          The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives.  These procedures include expected results.  The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests.  This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.<br></br>

    <section title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment" id="ava">168. For the first generation of this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to learn what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most cases, these vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, evaluators will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

          As with ATE_IND, the evaluator shall generate a report to document their findings with respect to this requirement.  This report could physically be part of the overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document.  The evaluator performs a search of public information to determine the vulnerabilities that have been found in redaction tools in general, as well as those that pertain to the particular <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>.  The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the vulnerabilities found in the report.  For each vulnerability found, the evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the vulnerability, if suitable.  Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability.  For example, if the vulnerability can be detected by pressing a key combination on boot-up, a test would be suitable at the assurance level of this <span title="Protection Profile">PP</span>.   If exploiting the vulnerability requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.
